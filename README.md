# Advent of Code

Personal solutions to the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). A challenge I started doing in 2023. I´ve
ended up loving the challenges and the learning it provides, encouraging me to complete it every year trying to improve
my skills in the journey.

- In 2023 I tried to make it in Modern C++
- In 2024 I tried to make it in Rust
- In 2025 I tried to make it in Rust
- I have also tried some other past years, mostly in Rust

I hope it results useful to anyone wanting to compare solutions and learn new ways of approaching the same problem.
